# Enhancing Inflation Nowcasting with LLM - *Sentiment Analysis on News*
> *Does incorporating a news sentiment index improve inflation nowcasting, particularly during periods of high volatility such as the COVID-19 pandemic?*

Code repository for the `FIN-407` course project. The report is available at [https://github.com/paultltc/InflaBERT/report.pdf](https://github.com/paultltc/InflaBERT/report.pdf).

#### Abstract
*This study explores integrating large language models (LLMs) into classic inflation nowcasting frameworks, particularly in light of high inflation volatility periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose \texttt{InflaBERT}, a BERT-based LLM fine-tuned to predict inflation-related sentiment in news. We use this model to produce \texttt{NEWS}, an index capturing the monthly sentiment of the news regarding inflation. Incorporating our expectation index into the Cleveland Fedâ€™s model, which is only based on macroeconomic autoregressive processes, shows a marginal improvement in nowcast accuracy during the pandemic. This highlights the potential of combining sentiment analysis with traditional economic indicators, suggesting further research to refine these methodologies for better real-time inflation monitoring.*
